            <h2>What is Bootstrap-Form?</h2>
            <p>n this chapter, we will study how to create forms with ease using Bootstrap. Bootstrap makes it easy with the simple HTML markup and extended classes for different styles of forms. In this chapter we will study how to create forms with ease
                using Bootstrap.</p>
            <p>Bootstrap provides you with following types of form layouts âˆ’ Vertical (default) form In-line form Horizontal form</p>

            <p>After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap,
                and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011.[5] It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of contributors</p>
            <p>Bootstrap 3 supports the latest versions of the Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari (except on Windows). It additionally supports back to IE8 and the latest Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR)</p>
            <p>Bootstrap is modular and consists of a series of Less stylesheets that implement the various components of the toolkit. These stylesheets are generally compiled into a bundle and included in web pages, but individual components can be included
                or removed. Bootstrap provides a number of configuration variables that control things such as color and padding of various components. Since Bootstrap 2, the Bootstrap documentation has included a customization wizard which generates
                a customized version of Bootstrap based on the requested components and various settings. As of Bootstrap 4, Sass is used instead of Less for the stylesheets. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and
                in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. Grid system and responsive design comes standard with an 1170 pixel wide grid layout. Alternatively, the developer can use a variable-width layout. For both cases, the toolkit has four variations
                to make use of different resolutions and types of devices: mobile phones, portrait and landscape, tablets and PCs with low and high resolution. Each variation adjusts the width of the column</p>

            <p>A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool.
                Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company."[4]</p>
