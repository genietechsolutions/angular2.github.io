            <h2>What is a Grid?</h2>
            <p>To put in simple words, grids in web design organise and structure content, makes the websites easy to scan and reduces the cognitive load on users.</p>
            <p>Let us understand the above statement. Bootstrap 3 is mobile first in the sense that the code for Bootstrap now starts by targeting smaller screens like mobile devices, tablets, and then “expands” components and grids for larger screens such
                as laptops, desktops.</p>
            <p>Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. Here's how the Bootstrap grid system works − Rows must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding. Use
                rows to create horizontal groups of columns. Content should be placed within the columns, and only columns may be the immediate children of rows. Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts.
                LESS mixins can also be used for more semantic layouts. Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and the last column via negative margin on .rows. Grid columns are created
                by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4.</p>
            <p>After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap,
                and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011.[5] It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of contributors</p>
            <p>Bootstrap 3 supports the latest versions of the Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari (except on Windows). It additionally supports back to IE8 and the latest Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR)</p>
            <p>Bootstrap is modular and consists of a series of Less stylesheets that implement the various components of the toolkit. These stylesheets are generally compiled into a bundle and included in web pages, but individual components can be included
                or removed. Bootstrap provides a number of configuration variables that control things such as color and padding of various components. Since Bootstrap 2, the Bootstrap documentation has included a customization wizard which generates
                a customized version of Bootstrap based on the requested components and various settings. As of Bootstrap 4, Sass is used instead of Less for the stylesheets. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and
                in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. Grid system and responsive design comes standard with an 1170 pixel wide grid layout. Alternatively, the developer can use a variable-width layout. For both cases, the toolkit has four variations
                to make use of different resolutions and types of devices: mobile phones, portrait and landscape, tablets and PCs with low and high resolution. Each variation adjusts the width of the column</p>

            <p>A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool.
                Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company."[4]</p>
